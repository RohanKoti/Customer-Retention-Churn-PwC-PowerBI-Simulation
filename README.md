**5 key insights from the Customer Churn Dashboard:**
1. High Customer Churn Rate: Out of 7,043 total customers, 1,869 (26.54%) have churned, indicating a significant percentage of customers leaving.
2. Dominant Payment Method: The most common payment method is Electronic Check, with 2.4K customers using it, compared to other methods like mailed checks and automatic payments.
3. Monthly Charges Dominated by Fiber Optic Customers: Customers with fiber optic services contribute to 62.11% of the total monthly charges, totaling $283.28K out of $456.1K, making them the highest revenue-generating group.
4. Month-to-Month Contracts Have the Highest Churn: 1.9K customers are on month-to-month contracts, and this category likely contributes significantly to the churn rate due to the ease of canceling such contracts.
5. Paperless Billing Adoption: 59.22% of customers (4.17K) are using paperless billing, suggesting a relatively good adoption of eco-friendly billing methods, though thereâ€™s still room for growth.

**Recommendation:**
1. Reduce Customer Churn: With a churn rate of 26.54%, efforts should focus on retention strategies, especially targeting customers on month-to-month contracts, as they represent a large portion of churn.
2. Increase Adoption of Automatic Payments: A significant number of customers still use electronic or mailed checks. Promoting automatic payment methods like credit card or bank transfer could improve customer retention and reduce administrative costs.
3. Promote Higher-Tier Services: Since Fiber optic customers contribute to the majority of monthly charges, marketing campaigns to convert DSL and No internet service customers to higher-tier fiber optic services could increase overall revenue.
